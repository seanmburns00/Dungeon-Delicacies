### 'Slow Cooker' Recipes

We all love using a slow cooker and giving no effort for a delicious meal. To easily find recipes that utilize a slow cooker there is a prefix to the name of the file/recipe. This also forces all slow cooker recipes to appear together in the list of recipes in any given category. 

```
Prefix:  [SC]
Example: [SC]Recipe Name.md
```

### 'Alcoholic' Beverages

For those of you who do not drink or are not legally allowed I have included a prefix tax to alcoholic drink files/recipes. This is also helpful for those only seeking these recipes. 

```
Prefix:  [A]
Example: [A]Recipe Name.md
```

### PDF Archive

When a new recipe is submitted a pdf file will be generated from the md file. This provides a place to download an print the recipe in the same styling as it appears when viewing the markdown file in GitHub.

This style of pizza originates from the South Shore area of Massachusetts and is known for its thin and crispy crust creating a cracker-like texture. The pizza is usually only made as a small pie.
